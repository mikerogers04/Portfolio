        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>
        After 12 years as an Independent Contractor in the Real Estate Industry, I'm heading into a new direction with my career. With prior education in Information Technology, I want to use what I have learned and combine it with my new skills I am currently learning and move into web development. While programming is not a new concept to me, I have been away from the field for 6 years. Realizing I never used my education to it's full potential, it has motivated me to pursue my dream job in the tech field. 
        </h2>
        
        <h2>
        I am currently a student at Learn Academy learning full stack web development. Learning different languages and frameworks to build my repertoire of tools for the ongoing journey. It is not how you start your journey, but how you continue to grow along the way in the face of adversity. Being challenged is something I take head on to prove to myself that I can do anything I set my mind to.
